# Notes
Currently:

- Done with html css and js for now. So nevermind trying react, tailwind, and sass.
- Starting python now yayyy
- Might not learn to touch type anytime soon.
- Ive recorded some guitar riffs i learned. Its not perfect but good enough yipe
- Hoping ill find good cs friend groups when classes start. The more the merrier cuz i need constructive peer pressure.
