# Notes
Currently:
- Wanna start using react, but im missing some prerequisites. Most js basics and css responsive layouts, i keep getting stuck wasting hours refusing to just google it.
- Making a notes app instead, to touch up on everything i missed, before trying react again.
- Wanna check tailwind and sass, if they'll help with the spaghetti.
- Wanna try python and learn pyodide so i dont have to learn new python gui stuff and instead focus on python and css.
- After learning some react and how to database stuff, maybe move on from frontend and try more logic heavy projects.
- Wanna add more guitar recordings to my site, but the high e string snapped, again.
- Have to start getting active on social media to, idk. But its important they said. Ill try.
- Gotta try touch typing again.
- Have so much i can dooo im getting confused. Also feeling like im not learning efficiently, or maybe just impatient.
